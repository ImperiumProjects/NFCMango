    <string name="placeholder">EMBL was not affected by the recent ransomware outbreaks WannaCry and Petya. These attacks only affect Windows computers, and can be prevented by regular patching, using recent OS versions, and using anti-virus protection. <a href="http://intranet.embl.de">Click me!</a> However, future outbreaks are expected and they will probably be more advanced. EMBL users are strongly advised to back up their data (Tier-1, ownCloud and others are backed up daily), to be careful with suspicious emails, and not to use USB sticks of unknown origin.

    <string name="charmander_fact_text">Nickname: Michael Wahlers \n \nHave you heard about the viruses WannaCry and Petya? Although EMBL
    was not affected due to security in place, it is important to protect yourself for any future outbreaks.
    Back up your data regularly! (consider centrally backed-up data storage such as Tier-1 or ownCloud),
    upgrade your OS and update your software to the most recent versions, use anti-virus protection, be
    suspicious emails and do not use USB sticks of unknown origin.
        <a href="https://intranet.embl.de/it_services/index.html">If in doubt, contact IT Services for advice</a></string>
    <string name="cubone_fact_text">Nickname: Erich Schechinger \n \nDo you know your IT Services? We consist of three teams - IT Operations, Desktop Support
    and Software and Solutions Development. IT Operations takes care of the data centre and IT infrastructure for daily
    use, access to emails, and high-performance computing. Desktop Support provides assistance for the three major operating
    systems (Windows, Mac and Linux), installs OS and software and helps troubleshooting hardware or software problems.
    Software and Solutions Development are in charge of custom software development involving mainly administrative web apps,
    the infrastructure for the EMBL web presence and our central databases.</string>
    <string name="eevee_fact_text">Nickname: Lilian Montero \n \nEMBL email was recently made much faster and more reliable! The EMBL email service
     is now powered by SSD disk and is being mirrored across two data centres for better resilience.</string>
    <string name="flareon_fact_text">Nickname: Carlos Fernandez \n \nWe\'ve been working hard to make our data centre and EMBL core IT services resilient.
    Our business continuity strategy builds on a second data centre hosting a hot-standby server virtualisation cluster and
    a copy of cross-centre mirrored data storage. This constantly developed infrastructure is what helps us prevent or limit down
    time for priority IT services such as network, WiFi, authentication, email and web in case of disasters
    and major issues with our primary data centre.</string>
    <string name="jigglypuff_fact_text">Nickname: Will Murphy \n \nHave you heard about the EMBL 3D Cloud? Based on high-performance graphics and
     visualisation power that is accessible from the Heidelberg data centre, it can support your QA, data analysis
     on-demand, anywhere and in a cost-efficient way. <a href="mailto:itsupport@embl.de">Contact IT Services to learn more.</a></string>
    <string name="jolteon_fact_text">Nickname: Carmelo Lopez-Portilla \n \nDid you know High Performance Computing at EMBL Heidelberg is quite popular across science?
    More than 200 users from groups at EMBL Heidelberg as well as those from other EMBL sites are using the EMBL HPC Cluster which currently
    has about 13,000 CPU cores, 70+TB of RAM and access to an ultrafast parallel file system.</string>
    <string name="meowth_fact_text">Nickname: Massimiliano Ceccarelli \n \nIs your Windows computer protected from malware threats? If your computer doesn\'t have any
    anti-virus protection installed, IT Services can install Kaspersky Anti-Virus for you - free of charge and even if you use
    a private computer for your work at EMBL. For more details, <a href="mailto:itsupport@embl.de">contact the Desktop Support team.</a></string>

    <string name="mr_mime_fact_text">Nickname: Alain Becam \n \nHave you heard about the new and improved EMBL Web Search? Based on ElasticSearch and
    search engine technology from Google it is not only faster and more accurate, but also much more user friendly. Don\'t
    believe us? <a href="https://itsnews.embl.de/new-embl-web-search/">Try it out on the intranet or on the EMBL external site.</a></string>
    <string name="onix_fact_text">Nickname: Jurij Pecar \n \nBack in March, all 4 IT departments from across EMBL came together for an <a href="https://intranet.embl.de/communication_outreach/internal_news/2017/170511-it-retreat/index.html">EMBL
    IT Retreat</a> here in Heidelberg to foster cross-site collaboration, knowledge exchange and exploring joint
    projects along a coherent IT strategy. Key topics discussed included simplified access to IT resources
     shared across EMBL, establishing networking standards or cross-site disaster recovery. The meeting was very
     successful and we hope that it results in improvements to the IT services we provide to you, our users.</string>
    <string name="pidgey_fact_text">Nickname: Luca Fasolino \n \nDid you know that users across EMBL have access to Google Calendar? Visit

    <string name="pikachu_fact_text">Nickname: Blaz Podrzaj \n \nIT Services has been working hard configuring the IT setup for the new EMBL
    Barcelona site. So far, the internal network, the firewalls and a 1Gb internet link have been established, which
    will be increased to a 10Gb link soon. The domain, web page, and user management are also up. Next
    up, data storage, virtualistion and computing will be configured. From all in IT Services, we want to give
    a warm welcome to EMBL Barcelona and wish them a big success!</string>
    <string name="slowpoke_fact_text">Nickname: Joaquim Batista \n \nDid you know that EMBL\'s data centre is virtualised? The team currently operates
    450 virtual servers based on 3 VM clusters with a total of 600 CPU Cores and 6TB of RAM, and we use VMware vSphere
     and VMware Horizon. The main benefits of data centre virtualisation are around manageability, resilience and cost savings
     in energy and space.</string>
    <string name="squirtle_fact_text">Nickname: Dan Anderson \n \nDid you know that you can connect to eduroam WiFi when travelling to one
    of the many eduroam partner sites world-wide? Just configure your eduroam account while on-site at EMBL and
    enjoy easy internet access while being away! Likewise, if you\'re visiting from another eduroam participating
    institution, you easily can access WiFi here. <a href="https://intranet.embl.de/it_services/services/network_access/Wireless_Access/eduroam/index.html">Configure your eduroam account.</a></string>
    <string name="vaporeon_fact_text">Nickname: Agustin Villalba Casas \n \nYou\'d need over 745 million floppy disks to store a single petabyte of data.
    Right now, our data centre can store around 25 petabytes of data on a multi-tiered data storage infrastructure using
    disk and tape technology.</string>
